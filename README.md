## Welcome to Better Mc Tools!

This resourcepack aims to give that cool modded feel to the vanilla minecraft tools in a resourcepack!
It was inspired by Furfsky Reborn, Rlcraft, ATM modpack, Better MInecraft Modpack, and some google images.

### Key Features

* Most of the tools (swords, pickaxes, shears, etc.) have custom 3d models and 128x textures almost like a mod!
* Works with optifine, iris, nvidium, vanilla and any other mods I can think of.
* Compatible with all shaders and can be used over any other packs.

### Important Note

**WARNING:** DO NOT DOWNLOAD FOR ANY SITE BESIDES PLANET MINECRAFT, MODRINTH AND CURSEFORGE

**Enjoy Better Mc Tools!**
